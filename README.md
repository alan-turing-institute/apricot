# Apricot

`Apricot` is a proxy for delegating LDAP requests to an OpenID Connect backend.
The name is a slightly tortured acronym for: LD**A**P **pr**oxy for Open**I**D **Co**nnec**t**.

## Usage

Start the `Apricot` server on port 1389 by running:

```bash
python run.py --client-id "<your client ID>" --client-secret "<your client secret>" --backend "<your backend>" --port "<your desired port>" --domain "<your domain name>" --redis-host "<your Redis server>"
```

If you prefer to use Docker, you can edit `docker/docker-compose.yaml` and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

from the `docker` directory.

### Pre-built Docker images

These are [available on `ghcr.io`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/apricot/pkgs/container/apricot).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/alan-turing-institute/apricot:latest
```

### Using Redis [Optional]

You can use a Redis server to store generated `uidNumber` and `gidNumber` values in a more persistent way.
To do this, you will need to provide the `--redis-host` and `--redis-port` arguments to `run.py`.

### Configure background refresh [Optional]

By default Apricot will refresh the LDAP tree whenever it is accessed and it contains data older than 60 seconds.
If it takes a long time to fetch all users and groups, or you want to ensure that each request gets a prompt response, you may want to configure background refresh to have it periodically be refreshed in the background.

This is enabled with the `--background-refresh` flag, which uses the `--refresh-interval` parameter as the interval to refresh the ldap database.

### Using TLS [Optional]

You can set up a TLS listener to communicate with encryption enabled over the configured port.
To enable it you need provide a path to the PEM files for the certificate `--tls-certificate=<path>` and the private key `--tls-private-key=<path>`.
To change the port from the default `1636` use `--tls-port`.

## Outputs

This will create an LDAP tree that looks like this:

```ldif
dn: DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: dcObject

dn: OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: users

dn: OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: groups
```

Each user will have an entry like

```ldif
dn: CN=<user name>,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
<user data fields here>
memberOf: <DN for each group that this user belongs to>
```

Each group will have an entry like

```ldif
dn: CN=<group name>,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
objectClass: posixGroup
objectClass: top
<group data fields here>
member: <DN for each user belonging to this group>
```

## Querying the server

Anonymous queries are enabled by default.

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://<your server location>:<your desired port> -x -b "DC=example,DC=com"
```

If you want to query on behalf of a particular user you will need to use the full distinguished name.

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://<your server location>:<your desired port> -x -b "DC=example,DC=com" -D "CN=<user name>,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com"
```

## OpenID Connect

Instructions for specific OpenID Connect backends below.

### Microsoft Entra

You will need to use the following command line arguments:

```bash
--backend MicrosoftEntra \
--entra-tenant-id "<your tenant ID>"
```

You will need to register an application to interact with `Microsoft Entra`.
Do this as follows:

- Create a new `App Registration` in your `Microsoft Entra`.
    - Set the name to whatever you choose (e.g. `apricot`)
    - Set access to `Accounts in this organizational directory only`.
    - Set `Redirect URI` to `Public client/native (mobile & desktop)` with a value of `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`
- Under `Certificates & secrets` add a `New client secret`
    - Set the description to whatever you choose (e.g. `Apricot Authentication Secret`)
    - Set the expiry time to whatever is relevant for your use-case
    - You **must** record the value of this secret at **creation time**, as it will not be visible later.
- Under `API permissions`:
    - Enable the following permissions:
        - `Microsoft Graph` > `User.Read.All` (application)
        - `Microsoft Graph` > `GroupMember.Read.All` (application)
        - `Microsoft Graph` > `User.Read.All` (delegated)
    - Select this and click the `Grant admin consent` button (otherwise each user will need to manually consent)

### Keycloak

You will need to use the following command line arguments:

```bash
--backend Keycloak \
--keycloak-base-url "<your hostname>/<path to keycloak>" \
--keycloak-domain-attribute "<the attribute used as your domain>" \
--keycloak-realm "<your realm>"
```

#### User domain attribute

You will need to add a custom attribute to each user you want Apricot to use.
The name of this attribute should be used as the value of the `--keycloak-domain-attribute` argument above.
The value of this attribute should be the same as the `--domain` argument to Apricot.

Any users with this attribute missing or set to something else will be ignored by Apricot.
This allows you to attach multiple Apricot servers to the same Keycloak instance, each with their own set of users.

:exclamation: You can disable user domain verification with the `--disable-user-domain-verification` command line option :exclamation:

#### Client application

You will need to register an application to interact with `Keycloak`.
Do this as follows:

- Create a new `Client` in your `Keycloak` instance.
    - Under `General Settings`:
        - Client type: `OpenID Connect`
        - Client name: `apricot`
    - Under `Capability config`
        - Enable `Client authentication`
        - Enable the following authentication flows and disable the rest:
            - `Direct access grants`
            - `Service accounts roles`
    - Save the client
- For the client you have just created
    - Under `Credentials` copy `client secret`
    - Under `Service accounts roles`:
        - Click on `Assign role` then `Filter by clients`
        - Assign the following roles:
            - `realm-management` > `view-users`
            - `realm-management` > `manage-users`
            - `realm-management` > `query-groups`
            - `realm-management` > `query-users`

## Configuring the Apricot LDAP server

### Anonymous binds

By default, Apricot allows anonymous queries.
If you would prefer to disable these, please use the `--disable-anonymous-binds` command line option.

### Primary groups

Apricot creates an associated group for each user, which acts as its POSIX user primary group.

For example:

```ldif
dn: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
...
memberOf: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
...
```

will have an associated group

```ldif
dn: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
objectClass: posixGroup
objectClass: top
...
member: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
...
```

:exclamation: You can disable the creation of these groups with the `--disable-primary-groups` command line option :exclamation:

## Mirrored groups

Apricot creates a group-of-groups for each group of users.
This simply contains the primary group for each user in the original group.
Note that these groups-of-groups are **not** `posixGroup`s as POSIX does not allow nested groups.

For example:

```ldif
dn:CN=Detectives,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
objectClass: posixGroup
objectClass: top
...
member: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
...
```

will have an associated group-of-groups

```ldif
dn: CN=Primary user groups for Detectives,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
objectClass: top
...
member: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
...
```

This allows a user to make a request for "all primary user groups needed by members of group X" without getting a large number of primary user groups for unrelated users. To do this, you will need an LDAP request that looks like:

```ldif
(&(objectClass=posixGroup)(|(CN=Detectives)(memberOf=Primary user groups for Detectives)))
```

which will return:

```ldif
dn:CN=Detectives,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
objectClass: posixGroup
objectClass: top
...
member: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
...

dn: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=groups,DC=example,DC=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
objectClass: posixGroup
objectClass: top
...
member: CN=sherlock.holmes,OU=users,DC=example,DC=com
...
```

:exclamation: You can disable the creation of mirrored groups with the `--disable-mirrored-groups` command line option :exclamation:
